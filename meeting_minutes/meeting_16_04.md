## Meeting Notes

### Priorities
- The priority is to develop an interaction with NAO around the "Baby Shark" song to make things fun.

### Desired Features
- An instructor could ask a question by showing something in their hand, and NAO would respond correctly.
- Instead of a strict script, the instructor could interact with Choregraphe or use a controller to be autonomous during the presentation.
- Use a remote control to navigate between different steps of the script.

### Use of Pepper
- Pepper will be used to welcome visitors to the aquarium.
- An event will be organized to showcase Pepper's functionalities to Odysseo collaborators.

### Staging
- A staging concept is considered to enhance interaction with NAO.

### Project and Objectives
The main objective is to analyze the impact of NAO's teaching skills on children. The project will start soon, and Odysseo plans to purchase a NAO robot. However, they want to ensure that there will always be students available to work on this project.
